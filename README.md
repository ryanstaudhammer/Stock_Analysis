# Stock Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### In this analysis of green stocks I analyzed a stock for the DAQO New Energy Corp. I looked at the trading volume, the stock's starting price and and compared it to the ending price over a year's time. I had access to data for more than just this company so we also analyzed a total of 12 stocks over a two year period. 
## Results
### 
The two years of data analyzed were 2017 and 2018. Based on the analysis of 2017 all but one of the 12 stocks analyzed had gains in 2017.
Stocks with gains are indicated in green, and red indicates losses.

In 2017, DQ was up an astonishing 199.4%. Though after I analyzed 2018, the upward trend in 2017 had come to a halt and all but two of the original 12 stocks had losses.

## Summary
In order to make my code work I had to refactor the code. After several attempts and help from the Ask BCS Learning Assistant I was able to get the code to work. Unfortunately I don't have times for the original code, since it never worked, but gosh darn, look at the times of that refactored code! Talk about fast.
